DevOps is a way of working where Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) work together to deliver software faster, safer, and more reliably.

 It’s not a single tool
 It’s not just CI/CD
 It’s a culture + practices + automation
 Developers wrote code 
Operations deployed it 
If something broke:
Dev said - Works on my machine
Ops said - Your code broke prod
Result:
Slow releases
Blame game start
Frequent outages
DevOps removed this wall.
